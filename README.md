# Different version of a Tic Tac Toe Game
This is a strategic game of tic tac toe that is a bit harder than the original version. 
The goal of the game is to match three of 
your colored pieces before your opponent does.

The first player is determined randomly. 
The starting player may place any piece of any size
from their characters to any spot on the board.

From here players will take turns placing their 
characters onto the board. Bigger pieces can 
always cover smaller ones which means you can 
place larger pieces over yours or your 
opponentâ€™s smaller ones. 

The game ends when a player 
manages to get 3 of their colored pieces in a row. 
The player to first complete this goal is the winner.
